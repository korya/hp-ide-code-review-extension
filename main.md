HP Pronq is a web based IDE as a service which is fully functioning when you
are offline, with desktop-like performance, ability to connect to git and svn
on-premise repositories and the ability to keep your 
source files solely on your local device in order to protect your privacy in
addition to being fully extensible for other developers 
to enrich its functionality and share it.

Most basic requirements: select changes for review, send request, persist the
request in the server, push notification to code reviewer, dedicated view for
changes (file tree, highlight added and removed lines, navigation, add inline
comments, approve/reject, update code review.

Enhancements: choose the code reviewer, integrate with source control (git
or general), support other changes types, approve/reject per change/file and
more.
